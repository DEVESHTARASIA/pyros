  Connection cache diff callback
* moved debug logging to special logdebug file to reduce terminal logspam.
* fixing tests
* fixed check for early topic detection and stabilize cache diff optimization.
* disabling some test to prevent catkin test hanging... but test pass when run without --with-xunit. probably a nose issue.

  not using requirements any longer since we dont have extra dependencies and catkin_pip_setup does install the package in dev mode.

* fix adding available services.
  improved logging.
  Conflicts:
  pyros/baseinterface/baseinterface.py
